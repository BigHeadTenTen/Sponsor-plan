### 我们是谁
Engine Girls是一个由热爱编程并且关注性别平等的攻城狮开发的编程教学组织，主要面向零编程基础又热爱编程的女性。学生可以自由选择软件开发、微信开发、数据分析等方面她们感兴趣的课题，在导师的指导下，组队合作完成项目。我们希望通过有趣的课堂教学活动让原本认为写代码“枯燥难懂”的女生爱上编程，让更多的女性能够加入程序员的大家庭。

### 我们的需求
由于我们的教学活动是非营利的，所以我们的经费非常有限。为了能给学生更好的学习体验，我们希望有足够的资金支付场地费用以及给优秀学员的奖品费用。在起步阶段，我们希望可以得到您2000元的资金支持。

### 我们的回报
作为赞助方的您，可以享受很多特权。也许有女生在您的资金支持下成为了优秀的程序媛，她也许会成为贵公司的一名出色员工。您也可以在我们的场地中放置公司的展示架或海报、利用我们的公众号为你们公司推送宣传、在现场现场对你们公司进行业务介绍等等。如果您有兴趣对我们提供赞助，更多的细节有待商谈。

### Who we are?
Engine Girls is an organization founded by a group of programmers who are devoted to increasing gender diversity in the tech community. We design programming courses that teach women who have no previous coding experience. Students are allowed to choose from various projects, such as software development, wechat development, data analysis, etc. Students will form groups and work on projects under a tutor's supervision. We hope to provide an opportunity for amateurs to become professionals, for programming averse girls to become enthusiasts.

### What we need?
Since our courses are non-profit, we have very limited budget for class activities. However, we do hope to provide students with better class experience by awarding outstanding students. We also of course need budget to cover our venue cost. That is why we are seeking for sponsors. Right now, we need 2000RMB to start our program.

### How can we repay?
As a sponsor, you definitely have privileges. You could recruit your prospective employees, display your posters in our class, advertise your company via our official wechat account, introduce your business during our activity, etc. More benefits and details could be discussed later if you would like to sponsor us.
